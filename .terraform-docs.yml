  This Terraform module enables a Vault/OpenBao instance to use GatePlane.

  * It can register all GatePlane plugins to the Vault/OpenBao instance's Plugin Catalog.
  This is a requirement for using `gateplane-io/terraform-gateplane-policy-gate` and the rest of the gates.


  * It can enable [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS)
  and [Content Security Policy (CSP) for IFrames](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/frame-ancestors)
  to allow browser access from additional origins, such as [`https://app.gateplane.io`](https://app.gateplane.io) (domain can be changed).
